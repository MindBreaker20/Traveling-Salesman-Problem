# Traveling-Salesman-Problem
## Instruction
Provided implementations of mentined algorithms are capable of reading different xlsx files with changed size and numbers. In order to obtain optimal solution there is need to set proper file and sheet names.
The purpose of this project is creation of 5 algorithms without usage of significant Python libraries

## Detailed description
Every algorithm has implemented two types of neighborhood: an exchange and an insertion (which is set as
default neighborhood).

## Listed optimization algorithms
- Tabu Search
- Hill Climbing with Multi-Start
- Nearest Neighbour
- Simulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm
